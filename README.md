# Studying-and-Modeling-Fly-Behavior-Across-Temporally-Diverse-Environments

This repository exists just to point to code that I wrote for my second paper at the Emonet Lab, in collaboration with postdoc Aarti Sehdev, [Temporal novelty detection and multiple timescale integration drive Drosophila orientation dynamics in temporally diverse olfactory environments](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010606). In this paper, we wanted to study how the temporal aspects of olfactory signals alone modulate fly olfactory navigation. We used optogenetics to create uniform, temporally precise fictive odor stimuli which we could use to probe fly behavior and devised and analyzed a dynamical model to describe their behavior. The software is located at https://zenodo.org/record/7658932.
